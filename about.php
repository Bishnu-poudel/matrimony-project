                     <p class="py-3">This ritual has been in practice since hundreds of years.
                        It is very sacred ritual and a real kanyaadaan as a virgin girl is handed over to the God.
                         Actually, in Ihi girl is married to a golden statue of lord Vishnu known as Suvarna Kumar
                          and Bel fruit is given as its witness. As bel fruit (wood apple) has a peculiar quality 
                          of not getting rotten and remaining fresh forever, it is sometimes considered as Divya Purusha
                          (divine male) or incarnation of the god. This ceremony lasts for two days. All the rituals of a
                           Hindu marriage are performed in this ceremony. So, these rituals need not be performed again while
                            getting married with a man. That's why in Newars it is not necessary for a Groom to go in wedding
                             procession [janti (nep.), Baraat (Hindi)]. The family members and friends bring the bride to groom's
                              house where few rituals are performed. But nowadays newar grooms take part in their wedding 
                              procession hence the wedding in this community has become a bit lengthy as compared before.
