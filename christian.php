<p class="card-text">From the earliest days of the Christian faith,
 Christians have honored marriage, or holy matrimony, as a divinely
  blessed, lifelong, monogamous union, between a man and a woman.
   According to the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer (1979), reflecting 
   the traditional view, "Christian marriage is a solemn and public covenant
    between a man and a woman in the presence of God,"[1] "intended by God
     for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort given one another in
      prosperity and adversity; and, when it is God's will, for the procreation 
      of children and their nurture."[2] However, while many Christians might
       agree with the traditional definition, the terminology and theological
        views of marriage have varied through time in different countries, and
         among Christian denominations.

Many Protestants consider marriage to be a sacred institution or "holy ordinance" of God.
 Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians consider marriage a holy sacrament or
  sacred mystery. However, there have been and are differing attitudes among denominations
   and individual Christians towards not only the concept of Christian marriage, but also 
   concerning divorce, remarriage, gender roles, family authority (the "headship" of the husband),
    the legal status of married women, birth control, marriageable age, cousin marriage,
     marriage of in-laws, interfaith marriage, same-sex marriage, and polygamy, among other topics
     , so that in the 21st century there cannot be said to be a single, uniform, worldwide
      view of marriage among all who profess to be Christians.</p>
