<p class="card-text">Historically the vedic marriage was but one of the few different types of Hindu marriage customs.
 Love marriage was also seen in historical Hindu literature and has been variously described by many names, 
 such as Gandharva vivaha. In certain poor vaishnav communities there is still a custom called kanthi-badal 
 which is an exchange of bead-garlands as a very simplified form of ritual in solitude in front of an idol
  of Krishna, considered a form of acceptable love marriage.

Elopement has also been described in old Hindu literature. Lord Krishna himself eloped with Rukmini on a
 horse chariot. It is written that Rukmini's father was going to marry her to Shishupal, against her wishes.
  Rukimini sent a letter to Krishna informing of a place and time to pick her up.</p>
